Theodore_Roosevelt_Jr., often referred to as Teddy or by his initials, T. R., was an American_politician, statesman, soldier, conservationist, naturalist, historian, and writer who served as the 26th_president of the United_States from 1901 to 1909. He previously served as the 25th vice_president_under_President_William McKinley from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd_governor_of_New_York from 1899 to 1900. Assuming the presidency_after_McKinley's assassination, Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the Republican_Party and became a driving force for anti-trust and Progressive_policies.

A sickly_child with debilitating_asthma, he overcame his health_problems as he grew by embracing a strenuous_lifestyle. Roosevelt integrated his exuberant_personality and a vast_range_of_interests and achievements into a "cowboy" persona defined by robust_masculinity. He was home-schooled and began a lifelong naturalist_avocation before attending Harvard_College. His book The Naval_War of 1812 (1882) established his reputation as a learned historian and popular_writer. Upon entering politics, Roosevelt became the leader of the reform_faction_of_Republicans in New_York's state_legislature. His first_wife and mother died on the same_night, devastating him psychologically. He recuperated by buying and operating a cattle_ranch in the Dakotas. Roosevelt served as Assistant_Secretary of the Navy under President_McKinley, and in 1898 helped plan the highly successful_naval_war_against_Spain. He resigned to help form and lead the Rough_Riders, a unit that fought the Spanish_Army_in_Cuba to great_publicity. Returning a war_hero, Roosevelt was elected governor_of_New_York in 1898. The New_York_state_party_leadership disliked his ambitious_agenda and convinced_McKinley to choose him as his running mate in the 1900 election. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously and the McKinleyâ€“Roosevelt_ticket won a landslide_victory based on a platform_of_victory, peace, and prosperity.

Roosevelt assumed the presidency_at_age 42, and remains the youngest person to become president of the United_States. As a leader of the progressive_movement he championed his "Square_Deal" domestic_policies. It called for fairness for all citizens, breaking of bad_trusts, regulation_of_railroads, and pure_food and drugs. Roosevelt prioritized conservation and established_national_parks, forests, and monuments to preserve the nation's natural_resources. In foreign_policy, he focused on Central_America, where he began construction of the Panama_Canal. Roosevelt expanded the Navy and sent the Great_White_Fleet on a world_tour to project American_naval_power. His successful_efforts to broker the end of the Russo-Japanese_War won him the 1906 Nobel_Peace_Prize, making him the first American to ever win a Nobel_Prize. Roosevelt was elected to a full_term in 1904 and promoted policies more to the left, despite growing opposition from Republican_leaders. During his presidency, he groomed his close_ally_William_Howard_Taft to succeed him in the 1908 presidential_election.

Roosevelt grew frustrated with Taft's conservatism and belatedly tried to win the 1912 Republican_nomination_for_president. He failed, walked out, and founded the new_Progressive_Party. He ran in the 1912 presidential_election and the split allowed the Democratic nominee_Woodrow_Wilson to win the election. Following the defeat, Roosevelt led a four-month_expedition to the Amazon_basin where he nearly died of tropical_disease. During World_War_I, he criticized Wilson for keeping the country out of the war, and his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected. Roosevelt considered running for president again in 1920, but his health continued to deteriorate and he died in 1919. Polls_of_historians and political_scientists rank him as one of the greatest presidents in American_history.

Early life and family
Theodore_Roosevelt at age 11
Theodore_Roosevelt_Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at 28 East_20th_Street_in_Manhattan, New_York_City. He was the second of four children born to socialite_Martha_Stewart_Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist_Theodore_Roosevelt_Sr. He had an older sister (Anna), a younger brother (Elliott) and a younger sister (Corinne). Elliott was later the father_of_Anna_Eleanor_Roosevelt who married Theodore's distant_cousin, Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt. His paternal_grandfather was of Dutch_descent; his other_ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore_Sr. was the fifth_son_of_businessman_Cornelius_Van Schaack "C._V._S." Roosevelt and Margaret_Barnhill as well as a brother_of_Robert_Roosevelt and James_A._Roosevelt. Theodore's fourth_cousin, James_Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father_of_President_Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt. Martha was the younger daughter of Major_James_Stephens_Bulloch and Martha_P. "Patsy" Stewart. Through the Van_Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler_family.

Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor_health and debilitating_asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden_nighttime_asthma_attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong_interest_in_zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead_seal at a local_market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the "Roosevelt_Museum_of_Natural_History". Having learned the rudiments_of_taxidermy, he filled his makeshift_museum_with_animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for exhibition. At age nine, he recorded his observation_of_insects in a paper entitled "The Natural_History_of_Insects".

Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent_leader_in_New_York's cultural_affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the American_Civil_War, even though his in-laws included Confederate_leaders. Roosevelt said, "My father, Theodore_Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage_with_gentleness, tenderness, and great_unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children_selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness."

6-year-old_Theodore and 5-year-old Elliott_watch_Lincoln's funeral_procession from the second-floor_window of their grandfather's mansion (at top_left, facing the camera), Manhattan, April 25, 1865.
Family_trips abroad, including tours_of_Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan_perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps_in_1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant_benefits of physical_exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy_regime_of_exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping_trip, he found a boxing_coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.

A 6-year-old_Roosevelt witnessed the funeral_procession_of_Abraham_Lincoln from his grandfather_Cornelius's mansion_in_Union_Square, New_York_City, where he was photographed in the window along with his brother_Elliott, as confirmed by his second_wife, Edith, who was also present.

Education
Roosevelt was homeschooled, mostly by tutors and his parents. Biographer_H._W._Brands argued that "The most obvious_drawback to his home_schooling was uneven_coverage of the various_areas of human_knowledge." He was solid in geography and bright in history, biology, French, and German; however, he struggled in mathematics and the classical_languages. When he entered Harvard_College_on_September 27, 1876, his father advised: "Take care of your morals first, your health next, and finally your studies." His father's sudden_death_on_February 9, 1878, devastated Roosevelt, but he eventually recovered and doubled his activities.

His father, a devout_Presbyterian, regularly led the family_in_prayers. While at Harvard, young_Theodore emulated him by teaching Sunday_School for more than three years_at_Christ_Church in Cambridge. When the minister_at_Christ_Church, which was an Episcopal_church, eventually insisted he become an Episcopalian to continue teaching in the Sunday_School, Roosevelt declined, and instead began teaching a mission_class in a poor_section_of_Cambridge.

He did well in science, philosophy, and rhetoric_courses but continued to struggle in Latin and Greek. He studied biology intently and was already an accomplished_naturalist and a published ornithologist. He read prodigiously with an almost photographic_memory. While at Harvard, Roosevelt participated in rowing and boxing; he was once runner-up in an intramural_boxing_tournament. Roosevelt was a member of the Alpha_Delta_Phi_literary_society (later the Fly Club), the Delta_Kappa_Epsilon_fraternity, and the prestigious_Porcellian_Club; he was also an editor of The Harvard_Advocate. In 1880, Roosevelt graduated Phi_Beta_Kappa (22nd of 177) from Harvard with an A.B._magna_cum_laude. Biographer_Henry_F._Pringle_states:

Roosevelt, attempting to analyze his college_career and weigh the benefits he had received, felt that he had obtained little from Harvard. He had been depressed by the formalistic_treatment of many_subjects, by the rigidity, the attention to minutiae that were important in themselves, but which somehow were never linked up with the whole.

Roosevelt's birthplace at 28 East_20th_Street_in_Manhattan, New_York_City
After his father's death, Roosevelt had inherited $65,000 (equivalent to $1,971,069 in 2022), enough_wealth on which he could live comfortably for the rest of his life. Roosevelt gave up his earlier plan of studying natural_science and decided to attend Columbia_Law_School instead, moving back into his family's home_in_New_York_City. Although Roosevelt was an able law_student, he often found law to be irrational. He spent much of his time writing a book on the War of 1812.

Determined to enter politics, Roosevelt began attending meetings_at_Morton_Hall, the 59th Street_headquarters_of_New_York's 21st District_Republican_Association. Though Roosevelt's father had been a prominent_member of the Republican_Party, the younger Roosevelt made an unorthodox_career_choice for someone of his class, as most of Roosevelt's peers refrained from becoming too closely involved in politics. Roosevelt found allies in the local_Republican_Party and defeated an incumbent Republican state_assemblyman tied to the political_machine_of_Senator_Roscoe_Conkling closely. After his election_victory, Roosevelt decided to drop out of law_school, later saying, "I intended to be one of the governing class."
